# **BMI-zing**

## **Site Overview**

Welcome to my user-friendly BMI Calculator website! This platform offers a simple and efficient tool for calculating your Body Mass Index. By inputting your height and weight, the calculator swiftly processes the information and provides your BMI value, indicating whether you fall within the underweight, normal, overweight, obese or extremely obese category. Understanding your BMI is crucial for assessing your overall health and fitness. The website not only computes your BMI but also offers additional information on what the BMI ranges signify and general tips for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Whether you're curious about your current BMI or aiming to track your fitness progress, BMI-zing is the go-to resource for a quick and accurate BMI assessment.

### **Color Scheme:**

When deciding the color scheme I wanted a light main body with accents of blue for a great aesthetic and black font text for a good contrast. The color palette was created using [https://coolors.co/]
![Color Palette](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/BMI-zing/blob/main/assets/images/colour-palette.png?raw=true)


I also created this color contrast grid using [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%0D%0A%23b3b1b1%2C%0D%0A%2300ccff%2C%0D%0A%23001a8c%0D%0A%0D%0A&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%0D%0A%23b3b1b1%2C%0D%0A%2300ccff%2C%0D%0A%23001a8c%0D%0A%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=large&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp), to check the contrast scored and ensure the text remains visible across the entire website and that the site is accessible to everyone.

### **Typography:**

I decided on using a Google font, called DM-Sans, for its clean and sharp look.

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

### **Header Element**

The header element includes the title of the website and has a gradient background that is in perfect contrast to the white text.
![Header](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/BMI-zing/blob/main/assets/images/header.png?raw=true)

## **Footer**

The footer includes a copyright notice at the bottom and has the same gradient background as the header, but the gradient is reversed.
![Footer](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/BMI-zing/blob/main/assets/images/footer.png?raw=true)

## **Page Content features**

### **Home Page Content:**

* This page contains an About Us section right after the hero image carousel, that gives a brief description about the comedy club, its history and what can you expect to find when you visit The Giggly Fox.
  
![About us section](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/aboutus.jpg?raw=true)

- The home page also contains an Upcoming Shows section, which shows the next 6 upcoming shows at the comedy club, including their date. Underneath these shows there is a button that redirects users to the Shows page, where they can see more information about these upcoming shows. On mobile phones, this section only shows the next 3 shows, as to decrease loading times and scrolling endlessly.
  
![Upcoming shows section](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/upcomingshows.jpg?raw=true)

- A third section that is individual to the home page, is the comedians sections, which shows 8 comedians that perform at the comedy club. Underneath these comedians images there is a button that redirects the user to the Comedians page, where they can see more information about these comedians. On mobile phone, the section only shows 4 comedians, as to load the page faster.
  
![Comedians section](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/comedianshomepage.jpg?raw=true)

### **404 Error Page Content**

* This page was created to mimic the effect of accessing a page or link that does not exist.
- The page displays a funny message to inform the user that the page that they were looking for is unavailable.
- Under the message displayed, there is a button that sends the user back to the Home page.

![404 Erorr page message](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/the-giggly-fox/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/404page.jpg?raw=true)

## **Future-Enhancements**

* Provided I would have had sufficient time, I would have added a few extra features to enhance the website's functionality. One of these would be a dedicated page to each comedian, allowing the comedian to share their latest videos and which shows are they doing down the road.
- I would also like to add a search bar at the top of the website, so the user can find specific information that they are looking for. These enhancements would make the website more user-friendly and accesible.

## **Testing Phase**

### **Testing During Development**

During the development process, I have been constantly testing the website in the following ways:

1. Manually testing each element of the page for responsiveness and accesibility via a live server opened using CodeAnywhere.

2. Published the page via GitHub pages and shared with friends and family to receive feedback.

3. Made use of Developer Tools from different Internet browsers, to continuously identify and troubleshoot any problems I encountered.

#### **Manual Testing**

* While testing the website, I have used 4 different browsers to make sure that it is cross-compatible. The desktop browsers I have used for the tesing were:

  - Firefox
  - Google Chrome
  - Microsoft Edge
  - DuckDuckGo

- I have also asked other people to test the website, using their personal iPhones and Macbooks using Safari, since I don't have access to these devices. To which they reported that they have not encountered any bugs.

#### **User Story Testing**

During my manual testing, I have tested every user story, to ensure that the needs of the users are met.

- As a user I want to see the subject matter of the page.
  - Issue: the About Us section didn't stand out, as to allow the user to notice it straight away.
  - Cause: the background of the About Us section was slightly darker than the body background.
  - Resolution: I added a 4px solid orange border, which captures the attention of the user and they can see the subject of the website in an instant.

- As a user I want to be able to easily navigate the page to find what I require in a quickly manner.
  - Issue: the user had to scroll for a long time up and down to find which section they were interested in.
  - Cause: the navbar was not fixed and there was no back to top button either.
  - Resolution: I added a back to top button to all 4 main pages, and I made the navbar fixed as well, so that the user can easily navigate the website.

- As a user I want to find the dates and times of show that I am interested in, without too much trouble.
  - Issue: the user could not find quickly all the times of the shows, from the landing page.
  - Cause: there was a list of shows on the Home page, but no button to take you to the Shows page instantly, without having to scroll all the way up to the top.
  - Resolution: I added a "View all shows" button that redirects the user straight to the Shows page.

- As a user I want to be able to find what comedians are performing at this venue.
  - Issue: the user could not find quickly all the comedians performing at the comedy club, from the Home page.
  - Cause: there was a section of Comedians on the landing page, but there wasn't any button to take you to the Comedians page instantly, without having to scroll all the way up to the top.
  - Resolution: I added a "View all comedians" button that takes the user instantly to the Comedians page.
  
- As a user I want to be able to contact the club easily.
  - Issue: the user could not contact the venue easily, without having to call the club.
  - Cause: there was an email address provided, but no contact form to make it easier for the user to contact The Giggly Fox.
  - Resolution: I added a contact form where the user can input their first and last name, email address, phone number and a text area where they can send all their questions and feedback to the club.

#### **Functionality testing**

* All the links, buttons and forms work as expected, with no errors.
