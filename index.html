            <p class="BMI-description">Body mass index (BMI) is a health metric used to gauge a person's weight category quickly, as it is a simple calculation
            of body fat relative to weight and height.
            
            While BMI has its limitations - and should not be the only metric considered when determining your weight class - it is a
            fast and accessible tool that can help you better understand whether you carry excess body fat, which can put you at
            risk for health complications ranging from type 2 diabetes to high blood pressure.</p>
